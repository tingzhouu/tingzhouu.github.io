TypeScript - Class Decorators

### Introduction

Class decorators provide the option to structure your code __differently__.

What can be done in class decorators, can also be achieved with usual TypeScript code.

Those who have largely been using JavaScript or TypeScript only may find the syntax of class decorators to be foreign, and confusing at times.

There are several popular open-source projects that use decorators, having this knowledge could come in handy. Some examples are:

- [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)
- [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
- [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)

### Simple Example

Let's try to model a cattle-farm with 2 breeds - Black Angus and Wagyu. We want to keep track of their breeds.

#### Without class decorators

We will create a class `Cow` having the class property `breed`. `BlackAngus` and `Wagyu` will be child classes of `Cow`.

```typescript
class Cow {
  breed: string;

  constructor(breed: string) {
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

class BlackAngus extends Cow {
  constructor() {
    super("black-angus");
  }
}

class Wagyu extends Cow {
  constructor() {
    super("wagyu");
  }
}

const blackAngus = new BlackAngus();
console.log(blackAngus.breed); // prints 'black-angus'

const wagyu = new Wagyu();
console.log(wagyu.breed); // prints 'wagyu'
```

#### With class decorators

We will create a class decorator `Breed` that takes in a single parameter `breed`.

Notice that this is declarative, i.e. we did not need to store a class variable and add a constructor, and could still get the breed.

```typescript
function Breed(breed: string): ClassDecorator {
  return function (target: object) {
    target["cowBreed"] = breed;
  };
}

class Cow {}

@Breed("black-angus")
class BlackAngus extends Cow {}

@Breed("wagyu")
class Wagyu extends Cow {}

const blackAngus = new BlackAngus();
console.log(blackAngus.constructor["cowBreed"]); // prints 'black-angus'

const wagyu = new Wagyu();
console.log(wagyu.constructor["cowBreed"]); // prints 'wagyu'
```
